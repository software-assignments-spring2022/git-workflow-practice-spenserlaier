## Discussion 

This is an interesting link I found about using the command
shell. It takes a shell string and provides information about
the various terms of the string. 
Since it's something I've found recently, I haven't used it
very often, but I've bookmarked it because it seems like a helpful
resource for learning how to use the command line interface. It 
also links to another website called showthedocs.com which 
does something similar, but for programming languages like mysql.
Both websites seem like helpful learning tools to me.
